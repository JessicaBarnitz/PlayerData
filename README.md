# Description: 
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of two different collision
resolution algorithms on a large set of data as it is inserted into a hash table, and observe how
the collisions of the hash table are affected by the hash function implemented to index the data
into the hash table.

# Compile: 
```
$ g++ -std=c++11 FinalProject.cpp HashTable.cpp -o hashTable
```

# Usage: 
```
$ ./hashTable (tableSize)
```
